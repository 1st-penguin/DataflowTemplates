# Google Cloud Dataflow Template Pipelines

These Dataflow templates are an effort to solve simple, but large, in-Cloud data
tasks, including data import/export/backup/restore and bulk API operations,
without a development environment. The technology under the hood which makes
these operations possible is the Google Cloud Dataflow service combined with a
set of Apache Beam SDK templated pipelines.

Google is providing this collection of pre-implemented Dataflow templates as a
reference and to provide easy customization for developers wanting to extend
their functionality.
